This is a POC of features from Hugo (gohugo.io) that I'd like to incorporate into our
docs. We probably can also use this in our articles and blog posts.

This feature relates to progressive disclosure. When we have a "lot" of content, 
many readers may want to skip over content such as descriptions of HNSW that they
already know. (Tip, click on the right facing arrow.)


{{% expand "More info on HNSW" %}}
Once we have a canonical Qdrant definition for HNSW, we can add it here.
{{% /expand %}}
