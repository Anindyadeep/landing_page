# Qdrant Hybrid Cloud on AWS

[Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) is a managed service to run Kubernetes in the AWS cloud and on-premises data centers which can then be paired with Qdrant's hybrid cloud. With Amazon EKS, you can take advantage of all the performance, scale, reliability, and availability of AWS infrastructure, as well as integrations with AWS networking and security services.
