# Qdrant Hybrid Cloud on GCP

[Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) is a managed Kubernetes service that you can use to deploy and operate containerized applications at scale using Google's infrastructure. GKE provides the operational power of Kubernetes while managing many of the underlying components, such as the control plane and nodes, for you.
