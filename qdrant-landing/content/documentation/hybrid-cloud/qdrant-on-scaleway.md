# Qdrant Hybrid Cloud on Scaleway

[Scaleway Kapsule](https://www.scaleway.com/en/kubernetes-kapsule/) and [Kosmos](https://www.scaleway.com/en/kubernetes-kosmos/) are managed Kubernetes services from [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/en/). It abstracts away the complexities of managing and operating a Kubernetes cluster. The primary difference being, Kapsule clusters are composed solely of Scaleway Instances. Whereas, a Kosmos cluster is a managed multi-cloud Kubernetes engine that allows you to connect instances from any cloud provider to a single managed Control-Plane.
