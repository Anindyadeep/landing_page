# Qdrant Hybrid Cloud on Akamai (Linode)

[The Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE)](https://www.linode.com/products/kubernetes/) is a managed container orchestration engine built on top of Kubernetes. LKE enables you to quickly deploy and manage your containerized applications without needing to build (and maintain) your own Kubernetes cluster. All LKE instances are equipped with a fully-managed control plane at no additional cost.

Once you've got a Kubernetes cluster deployed on Akamai (Linode), you can begin setting up Qdrant hybrid cloud. Head over to our [Qdrant Hybrid Cloud](/documentation/cloud/hybrid-cloud/) guide to know more.
