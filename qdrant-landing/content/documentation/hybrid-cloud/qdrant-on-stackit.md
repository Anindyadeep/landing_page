# Qdrant Hybrid Cloud on STACKIT

[STACKIT Kubernetes Engine (SKE)](https://www.stackit.de/en/product/kubernetes/) is a robust, scalable, and managed Kubernetes service. SKE supplies a CNCF-compliant Kubernetes cluster, and makes it easy to provide standard Kubernetes applications and containerized workloads. User-defined Kubernetes clusters can be created as self-service without complications using the STACKIT Portal.
