[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE)](https://www.oracle.com/in/cloud/cloud-native/container-engine-kubernetes/) is a managed Kubernetes solution that enables you to deploy Kubernetes clusters while ensuring stable operations for both the control plane and the worker nodes through automatic scaling, upgrades, and security patching. Additionally, OKE offers a completely serverless Kubernetes experience with virtual nodes.
