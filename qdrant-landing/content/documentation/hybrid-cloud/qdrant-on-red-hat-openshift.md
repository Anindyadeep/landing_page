# Qdrant Hybrid Cloud on RedHat OpenShift

[Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes Engine](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/kubernetes-engine) provides you with the basic functionality of Red Hat OpenShift. It offers a subset of the features that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform offers, like full access to an enterprise-ready Kubernetes environment and an extensive compatibility test matrix with many of the software elements that you might use in your datacenter.
