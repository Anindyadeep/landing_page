# Qdrant Cloud on GCP Marketplace

Our [GCP Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/qdrant-public/qdrant)
listing streamlines access to Qdrant for users who rely on the Google Cloud Platform for
hosting and application development. While Qdrant's clusters run on GCP, you are using the
Qdrant Cloud infrastructure. 

## Billing

You don't need a credit card to sign up for Qdrant Cloud. Instead, all billing is
processed through the GCP Marketplace. Usage is added to your existing billing
for GCP.

Payment is made through your GCP Account. Our [Billing Calculator](https://cloud.qdrant.io/calculator)
can provide more information about costs.

Costs from cloud providers are based on usage. You can subscribe to Qdrant on
the GCP Marketplace without paying more.

## How to subscribe

1. Go to the [GCP Marketplace listing for Qdrant](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/qdrant-public/qdrant).
1. Select **Subscribe**. (If you have already subscribed, select
   **Manage on Provider**.)
1. On the next screen, choose options as required, and select **Subscribe**.
1. On the pop-up window that appers, select **Sign up with Qdrant**.

GCP transfers you to the [Qdrant Cloud](https://cloud.qdrant.io/).

The Billing Details screen opens in the Qdrant Cloud Console. If you do not
already see a menu, select the "hamburger" icon (with three short horizontal
lines) in the upper-left corner of the window.

> **Note:** You do not have to return to GCP. All Qdrant infrastructure is provisioned from the Qdrant Cloud Console.
