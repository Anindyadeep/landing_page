# Qdrant Cloud on AWS Marketplace

## Overview

Our [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-rtphb42tydtzg) listing makes it simpler to access Qdrant for users who wish to host all of their infrastructure on Amazon Web Services.
Using this option is simple and isn't any more different than directly signing up with Qdrant Cloud. 

## Billing

You might see that AWS gives an ambiguous price for Qdrant. It is common to abstract usage based pricing in the AWS marketplace, as there are too many factors to model billing from the AWS side.

The pricing you'll see in Qdrant Cloud while booking will apply normally.
However, the payment carried out via your AWS account. To get a clearer idea for the pricing structure, please use our [Billing Calculator](https://cloud.qdrant.io/calculator).

## How to subscribe

1. Go to [Qdrant's AWS Marketplace listing](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-rtphb42tydtzg).
2. Click the bright orange button - **View purchase options**. 
3. On the next screen, under Purchase, click **Subscribe**.
4. Up top, on the green banner, click **Set up your account**.

You will be transferred outside of AWS to [Qdrant Cloud](https://qdrant.to/cloud) via your unique AWS Offer ID. 

The Billing Details screen will open in Qdrant Cloud Console. Stay in this console if you want to create your first Qdrant Cluster hosted on AWS.

> **Note:** You do not have to return to the AWS Control Panel. All Qdrant infrastructure is provisioned from the Qdrant Cloud Console.
