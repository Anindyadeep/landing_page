> *"So usually I get asked, why are you using Qdrant? What's the big deal? Why are you picking these over all of the other ones? And to me it boils down to, aside from being renowned or recognized, that it works fairly well. There's one core component that is critical here, and that is it has to be very straightforward, very easy to set up so that I can teach it, because if it's easy, well, sort of like easy to or straightforward to teach, then you can take the next step and you can make it a little more complex, put other things around it, and that creates a great development experience and a learning experience as well.”*\

## More Quotes from Alfredo:

*"Qdrant makes it straightforward. We use it in-memory for my classes and I would love to see something similar setup in Rust to make teaching even easier.”*\
— Alfredo Deza

*"Retrieval augmented generation is kind of like having an open book test. So the large language model is the student, and they have an open book so they can see the answers and then repackage that into their own words and provide an answer.”*\
— Alfredo Deza

*"With Qdrant, I appreciate that the use of the Python API is so simple. It avoids the complexity that comes from having a back-end system like in Rust where you need an actual instance of the database running.”*\
— Alfredo Deza
