> "Was it possible to somehow maybe find a way to transfer this feeling that we have this vibe and get the help of AI to understand what exactly we need at that moment in terms of songs?”\

Imagine if the recommendation system could understand spoken instructions or hummed melodies. This would greatly impact the user experience and accuracy of the recommendations.

Filip Makraduli, an electrical engineering graduate from Skopje, Macedonia, expanded his academic horizons with a Master's in Biomedical Data Science from Imperial College London. 

Currently a part of the Digital and Technology team at Marks and Spencer (M&S), he delves into retail data science, contributing to various ML and AI projects. His expertise spans causal ML, XGBoost models, NLP, and generative AI, with a current focus on improving outfit recommendation systems. 

Filip is not only professionally engaged but also passionate about tech startups, entrepreneurship, and ML research, evident in his interest in Qdrant, a startup he admires.

## **Top Takeaways:**

Take a look at the song vibe recommender system created by Filip Makraduli, Data Scientist at Marks and Spencer. Find out how it works!

Filip discusses how AI can assist in finding the perfect songs for any mood. He takes us through his unique approach, using human language and AI models to capture the essence of a song and generate personalized recommendations.

Here are 5 key things you'll learn from this video:

1. How AI can help us understand and capture the vibe and feeling of a song
2. The use of language to transfer the experience and feeling of a song
3. The role of data sets and descriptions in building unconventional song recommendation systems
4. The importance of encoding text and using sentence transformers to generate song embeddings
5. How vector spaces and cosine similarity search are used to generate song recommendations

> Fun Fact: Filip actually created a Spotify playlist in real-time during the video, based on the vibe and mood Demetrios described, showing just how powerful and interactive this AI music recommendation system can be!

## More Quotes from Filip:

"When you log in with Spotify, you could get recommendations related to your taste on Spotify or on whatever app you listen your music on.”\
-- Filip Makraduli

"Once the user writes a query and the query mentions, like some kind of a mood, for example, I feel happy and it's a sunny day and so on, you would get the similarity to the song that has this kind of language explanations and language intricacies in its description.”\
-- Filip Makraduli

"I've explored Qdrant and as I said with Spotify web API there are a lot of things to be done with these specific user-created recommendations.”\
-- Filip Makraduli
