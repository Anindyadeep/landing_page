## More Quotes from Syed:

*"Qdrant is having the ease of use. And it, I have, I have trained people in my team who specialize with Qdrant, and they were initially using Weaviate and Pinecone.”*\
— Syed Asad

*"So what is happening nowadays is that the clients or the projects in which I am particularly working on are having more of multimedia or multimodal approach. So that is what is happening. So they want their apps or their LLM apps to be more engaging rather than a mere chatbot.”*\
— Syed Asad

*"So that is where the accuracy matters the most. Accurate. And in this case, Qdrant has proved just commendable in giving excellent search results.”*\
— Syed Asad in Advancements in Medical Imaging Search
