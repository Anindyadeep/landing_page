> *"We want that when things are actually similar or whatever is our definition of similarity. They are close to each other and if they are not, they're far from each other. This is what a model or embedding model tries to do basically in this piece.”*\

## **Top Takeaways:**

Nirant Kasliwal, AI Engineer at Qdrant joins us on Vector Space Talks to dive into FastEmbed, a lightning-quick method for generating embeddings.

In this episode, Nirant shares insights, tips, and innovative ways to enhance embedding generation.

5 Keys to Learning from the Episode:

1. Nirant introduces some hacker tricks for improving embedding models - you won't want to miss these!
2. Learn how quantized embedding models can enhance CPU performance.
3. Get an insight into future plans for GPU-friendly quantized models.
4. Understand how to select default models in Qdrant based on MTEB benchmark, and how to calibrate them for domain-specific tasks.
5. Find out how Fast Embed, a Python library created by Nirant, can solve common challenges in embedding creation and enhance the speed and efficiency of your workloads.

> Fun Fact: The largest header or adapter used in production is only about 400-500 KBs -- proof that bigger doesn't always mean better!

## More Quotes from Nirant:

*"There is the academic way of looking at and then there is the engineer way of looking at it, and then there is the hacker way of looking at it. And I will give you all these three answers in that order.”*\
-- Nirant Kasliwal

*"The engineer's mindset now tells you that the best way to build something is to make an informed guess about what workload or challenges you're going to foresee. Right. Like a civil engineer builds a bridge around how many cars they expect, they're obviously not going to build a bridge to carry a shipload, for instance, or a plane load, which are very different.”*\
-- Nirant Kasliwal

*"I think the more correct way to look at it is that we use the CPU better.”*\
-- Nirant Kasliwal
